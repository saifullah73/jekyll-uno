      <p>Hi, I'm Saifullah. I study Software Engineering at the National University Of Sciences and Technology and I am currently undergoing my Junior Year. My major interest lies in the fields of App Development and Machine Learning, both of which I have been actively pursuing.<br>
      This is my personal blog. If you want to follow me, know my interests, my habits or just in general, want to know me better, then you are at the right place.
      <br>Btw, not to brag or anything, I have a CGPA of 4.00, cheers! </p>
